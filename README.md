# GetandCleanData-CourseProject
**This repository contains the submission for the Course Project of the course ["Getting and Cleaning Data"] (https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) which is a part of a [Data Science] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience) specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University on [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/browse).**

The repository contains the following files-

- **README.md**

- **run_analysis.R**: It is an R code that coverts the raw data into a tidy data set.

**Note.** The code functions using the latest versions of the "data.table" and the "dplyr" package. It is strongly recommended to update your package to the latest version ([Version 1.9.6] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) for "data.table and [Version 0.4.3] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) for "dplyr" package) for the proper functioning of the code. 

The packages can be directly updated from the R console using the following code-
`update.packages(c("data.table","dplyr"))`

- **Code Book.md**: It gives a detailed description of the raw data set as well as the tidy data set obtained by processing the data using the "run_analysis.R" code.
